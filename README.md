# [Kedypaint](https://kedypaint.bykevin.work/)

I built this webapp because of confusion, in May or April 2020 i'll paint my room, my room size is 3.5x3.4 (LxWxH) and the problem is i don't know how much paint do i need so that is why I built [Kedypaint](https://kedypaint.bykevin.work/).
<br>
<br>
fun fact, i thought i'll spend about Rp 1500.000 / $107.32 (US) because i don't know how much paint do i need and because of this maybe i'll spend about $42.93 (i hope).
<br>

btw for the formula i got from [pratamabangunan.com](https://www.pratamabangunan.com/id/tips-and-trick/panduan-penghitungan-kebutuhan-cat).
